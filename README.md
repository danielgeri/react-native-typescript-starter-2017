# A React-Native &amp; TypeScript Starter for 2017

## Why Another Starter?

Most TypeScript starters use [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings), however Typings is 
[no longer being developed](https://github.com/typings/typings/issues/738) and 
[@Types](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/) should be used instead.
