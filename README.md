# A React-Native &amp; TypeScript Starter for 2017

## Why Another Starter?

Most TypeScript starters use [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings), however typings is 
[no longer being developed](https://github.com/typings/typings/issues/738) and 
[@Types](https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/) should be used instead.

## How To Run

See the wiki for environment setup.

```
yarn build
yarn run-android
```

## What's Missing

* [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) will be included once the 
[typing issue](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/14324) is fixed.
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) based testing.
